The protection level of this property indicates that it can be accessed by this class and any subclasses, but not by external classes. The `TagType` property stores information about the type of tag this completion data is associated with.\n\nThe constructor for `TagCompletionData` accepts two parameters: a string `text` and a `TagType` `tagType`. It passes the `text` parameter to the base class (`CompletionData`) constructor while it keeps the `tagType` parameter for its own use. When an object of `TagCompletionData` is instantiated, it initializes the base class with the provided `text` and sets the `TagType` property with the corresponding tag type. Additionally, it sets the `Icon` property with an appropriate icon representing the tag type \u2013 the icon is retrieved through a call to a method called `GetIconForTagType` from a presumably separate utility class named `CompletionIcons`. If no valid icon is found, a default icon represented by `CompletionIcons.Invalid` is used instead.\n\nFurthermore, the `Description` property is set to a string value representation of the tag type, which is fetched using a method named `GetStringValue()`, likely extending the information about the tag type beyond the enumeration value.\n\nThe XML documentation comment `/// <inheritdoc />` just above the constructor suggests that this class follows the inheritance policy of XML documentation comments. This means that, wherever this constructor overrides a member from its base class and doesn't have its own description, it will inherit the XML documentation of that member from the base class.\n\nOverall, `TagCompletionData` customizes completion data specific to tags, presumably to be used in some form of UI or code editor environment that provides auto-completion functionality for tags.

This attribute is likely part of a code generation framework that automatically creates a corresponding public property with the necessary notification logic for changes (according to the MVVM pattern). The CivitFile property represents an actual file related to the \"Civit\" context, although further context is needed to understand the exact nature of this file.\n\n2. `[ObservableProperty] private bool isInstalled;`\nSimilarly, there is a private boolean field `isInstalled` marked with [ObservableProperty], indicating whether the \"CivitFile\" is installed.

The architecture suggests the use of Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern where the ViewModel handles the logic for the UI.\n\nThe class is annotated with `[View(typeof(SharpenCard))]`, which likely associates this ViewModel with a view component (presumably the SharpenCard view). Additionally, the `[ManagedService]` and `[Transient]` attributes suggest that this class is managed by a dependency injection container, wherein a new instance of the ViewModel is created each time one is requested (`[Transient]` scope).\n\nWithin this ViewModel, three private fields define properties of a sharpening process, possibly for image processing use. Each of these private fields are decorated with the `[ObservableProperty]` attribute, which is a feature in some frameworks (like MVVM frameworks) that facilitates automatic property change notifications. This is typically used to update the UI when the property value changes. Moreover, each private field also has a `[Range]` attribute which specifies the inclusively valid range of values for the property.\n\n- `sharpenRadius`: an `int` property for defining the radius that the sharpening effect will have, with valid values ranging from 1 to 31.

IconSource is an IconSource property that creates a new SymbolIconSource object initialized with the BrainCircuit symbol, filled to represent an icon visually within the app.\n\nThe class also features a public property Pages, which is an IReadOnlyList of TabItem objects. The list is populated by converting a new List of TabViewModelBase objects, initialized with the instances passed into the constructor (i.e., civitAiBrowserViewModel and huggingFaceViewModel), into TabItem objects. Each TabItem object's Header property is set to the corresponding view model's Header property, and the Content property is set to the view model itself. This setup suggests that the CheckpointBrowserViewModel is responsible for managing a collection of tabs, each represented by a different view model, and suitable for displaying within a tabbed UI component in the application's user interface.\"",

This class is associated with a visual component, indicated by the `[View(typeof(FreeUCard))]` attribute, signifying that it is tied to a user control or a view which is likely a card component in the Avalonia UI library designed to display free-form content.\n\nThe class is annotated with the `[ManagedService]` and `[Transient]` attributes. `[ManagedService]` likely indicates that the class is automatically managed for dependency injection purposes, while `[Transient]` suggests that a new instance of this view model is created every time it is requested, rather than re-using a single instance.\n\nFreeUCardViewModel has a constant string `ModuleKey` with a value of \"FreeU\", which might be used to uniquely identify the module or functionality that this ViewModel represents within the larger application. This could be used for navigation, serialization, or logging purposes.\n\nThe class contains four private fields; b1, b2, s1, and s2, each representing some numerical value within the range of 0 to 10. These fields are doubles, and have a default value set to them: b1 is initialized to 1.5, b2 to 1.6, s1 to 0.9, and s2 to 0.2. Each of these fields is accompanied by a set of attributes:\n\n- `[ObservableProperty]`: This indicates that changes to the value of this property will notify any observers, likely meaning this field backs a property that supports two-way data binding in the UI framework. Changes in the UI will update the property and vice versa.\n- `[NotifyDataErrorInfo]`: It suggests that the ViewModel is integrated with the data validation system and will provide feedback if the property's value is not valid according to certain rules.\n- `[Required]`: This enforces that a value must be provided for this property; it cannot be left unset or null.\n- `[Range(0D, 10D)]`: This attribute specifies that the property's value must fall between 0 and 10, both being inclusive. Any value outside this range will be considered invalid.\n\nThis ViewModel class seems to be designed to facilitate user interaction with a set of numerical values within specified boundaries. It maintains strict data validation rules, ensuring integrity through attributes that automatically manage data validation and notifications of state changes to the system and the user interface.

As its name suggests, the class serves as the ViewModel in a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, presumably for a view component responsible for managing batch sizes within an application, such as a BatchSizeCard, hinted at by the `View` attribute.\n\nThe class is adorned with three attributes: `View`, `ManagedService`, and `Transient`, which indicate how it interacts with other components and its lifecycle:\n- `View` attribute could be specifying the association with a specific view, possibly a user interface component referred to as BatchSizeCard.\n- `ManagedService` may be indicating that this ViewModel is provided and managed by some inversion of control container or service locator.\n- `Transient` suggests that a new instance of BatchSizeCardViewModel is created each time one is requested, as opposed to being a singleton or scoped service.\n\nThe class inherits from LoadableViewModelBase and implements an interface called IComfyStep. LoadableViewModelBase suggests that this ViewModel might contain logic for handling asynchronous loading operations, while the IComfyStep interface might define a standardized way of applying steps or modifications in a process flow.\n\nBatchSizeCardViewModel contains private fields for managing batch size configuration, which are decorated with several attributes to control their behavior:\n\n1. `batchSize`: An integer property with an initial value of 1, constrained to values between 1 and 1024. The property raises notifications when its data errors or value change.\n\n2. `batchCount`: Another integer property set to 1 by default and constrained to values between 1 and the maximum value an integer can hold. Like `batchSize`, it utilizes notifications for data errors and value changes.\n\n3. `isBatchIndexEnabled`: A boolean field indicating if batch indexing is enabled or not, also raising notifications for data errors and when the value is changed.\n\n4. `batchIndex`: An integer property similar to `batchSize`, initialized to 1 and constrained to values between 1 and 1024, supporting data error and change notifications.\n\nEach property makes use of `NotifyDataErrorInfo` and `ObservableProperty` attributes to facilitate data validation and automatic UI updates via data binding. Additionally, `Range` and `Required` attributes are used to enforce value constraints and mandatory assignments, respectively.\n\nThe public method `ApplyStep` accepts a ModuleApplyStepEventArgs parameter, which provides access to a builder that holds connection information. Within the method, two properties of the connections, `BatchSize` and `BatchIndex`, are assigned based on the ViewModel's properties and whether batch indexing is enabled. The use of a nullable type for `BatchIndex` indicates that if `IsBatchIndexEnabled` is false, a null value is assigned, likely representing the absence of a batch index.\n\nOverall, BatchSizeCardViewModel appears to be designed to facilitate the configuration and management of batch processing, representing a step in a larger workflow within a software application that requires user input on batch sizes and counts, possibly with visualization through a corresponding view component.",

Whenever progress of an item changes, this method is triggered. It checks if the progress update is relevant to this particular item (by comparing `ProgressId` with `Id`). If it is, it updates the progress value, failed status, progress text, and indeterminate status based on the provided `ProgressItem`.\n\n- `GetProgressText` Method: This private method accepts a `ProgressReport` object and returns a string representing the text to display for a progress report UI element.

The constraint `where TKey : notnull` indicates that `TKey` must be a non-nullable type. This class represents a substantial building block within the system, most likely intended for use within image indexing or similar domains.\n\nThe class has the following members:\n\n1. **Private Fields:**\n   \n   - `private readonly IImageIndexService imageIndexService;` - This field signifies a dependency on an image indexing service represented by the `IImageIndexService` interface. It is marked as `readonly`, indicating that it can only be assigned in the constructor and not changed later.\n\n2. **Public Properties:**\n\n   - `public string? RelativePath { get; set; }` - This nullable property is used to store a relative path, which might be associated with the indexed items. The inclusion of `?` allows for the property to be null, accommodating scenarios where a path may not be required or available.\n\n3. **Public ReadOnly Properties:**\n\n   - `public SourceCache<TObject, TKey> ItemsSource { get; }` - This property is an instance of `SourceCache<TObject, TKey>`, which is responsible for managing a cache of items and their keys. `SourceCache` is a part of the Dynamic Data library, which provides dynamic data capabilities for collections.\n   \n   - `public IObservableCollection<TObject> Items { get; }` - This property is initialized with a new `ObservableCollectionExtended<TObject>`. The `ObservableCollectionExtended` class is likely an enhanced version of the standard `IObservableCollection` with extended functionality. This collection exposes the indexed objects to the outside world, allowing observers to react to collection changes. \n\n4. **Constructor:**\n\n    The `IndexCollection` constructor takes the following parameters:\n    \n    - `IImageIndexService imageIndexService` - A service dependency required for image indexing operations.\n   \n    - `Func<TObject, TKey> keySelector` - A function delegate that defines how to extract a key from an object of type `TObject`.\n    \n    - `Func<IObservable<IChangeSet<TObject, TKey>>, IObservable<IChangeSet<TObject, TKey>>>? transform` - An optional transformation function that can be applied to the changeset observable. This could be used for filtering, sorting, or other transformations.\n\n    The constructor initializes the `ItemsSource` with the provided key selector function. It then connects the source cache's change notification stream to `Items`, the observable collection, using the `Connect` and `Bind` methods provided by Dynamic Data. Optional transformation logic can be applied to the change set prior to binding.\n\n5. **Public Methods:**\n\n   - `public void Add(TObject item)` - This method allows adding an item to the `ItemsSource`, thereby updating the cache and, subsequently, the `Items` collection.\n   \n   - `public void Remove(TObject item)` - This method removes an item from the `ItemsSource` based on the object itself.\n   \n   - `public void RemoveKey(TKey key)` - This method removes an item based on its key, demonstrating that the collection can be manipulated either via objects or keys.\n\nThe `IndexCollection` class integrates with Dynamic Data's reactive collection mechanisms and encapsulates the handling of items and their respective keys in a convenient and observable way.

The class is decorated with a `SuppressMessage` attribute to indicate to the ReSharper analyzer that certain members can be public for use outside of this class and should not be flagged as needing to be private.\n\nThe class defines several static readonly fields, each representing a specific type of icon that can be associated with different completion item categories, like general items, artists, characters, etc. Each `IconData` contains properties defining the icon's appearance, such as the `FAIcon`, which is a string denoting a FontAwesome icon class, and `Foreground`, which specifies the color of the icon. Some icons have additional properties like `FontSize`.\n\nHere is the list of icon data members along with their visual description:\n\n1. `General`: Displays a star-of-life symbol with a color defined by `ThemeColors.LightSteelBlue`.\n2. `Artist`: Shows a palette symbol indicative of an artist or creatives, with a foreground color of `ThemeColors.AmericanYellow`.\n3. `Character`: Represents a user or character icon, colored with `ThemeColors.LuminousGreen`.\n4. `Copyright`: Uses a copyright symbol with a `ThemeColors.DeepMagenta` color.\n5. `Species`: Depicts a dragon icon and is unique in having a font size set to 14. Its color is set to `ThemeColors.HalloweenOrange`.\n6. `Invalid`: Uses a question mark icon to represent an invalid or unknown item, with a foreground brushing defined by `ThemeColors.CompletionForegroundBrush`.\n7. `Keyword`: A key symbol is used to represent a keyword, colored using the `ThemeColors.CompletionForegroundBrush`.\n8. `Model`: Displays a cube icon for models, also with a foreground defined by `ThemeColors.CompletionForegroundBrush`.\n9. `ModelType`: Shows a shapes symbol for model types with a color of `ThemeColors.BrilliantAzure`.\n\nFurther, the class provides a public static method `GetIconForTagType` which accepts an argument of type `TagType` (an enum or similar type not detailed in the source provided) and returns an `IconData` object corresponding to the provided `TagType`. The method uses a switch expression to return the appropriate icon. If a `TagType` does not match any defined case, the method returns `null`.\n\nThe usage of this class would be in displaying different icons next to the suggestions in a code completion list, allowing users to quickly identify the type of suggestion (e.g., a keyword, a model, a character, etc.) based on the icon displayed.

It is a subclass of PageViewModelBase and is adorned with two attribute decorators: [View(typeof(SettingsPage))] and [Singleton]. This indicates that it is associated with a 'SettingsPage' view and should be instantiated as a singleton within the application lifecycle, respectively.\n\nDetailed description of its members:\n\n1. Title Property: This property is an override of a base class property, providing a string specifically for the \"Settings\" page title.\n\n2. IconSource Property: Also an override, it provides an IconSource for the view model's associated GUI element. It uses a 'SymbolIconSource' pre-initialized with the 'Settings' symbol and specified to be 'filled'.\n\n3. SubPages Readonly Property: This exposes a read-only list of PageViewModelBase types. It contains different subpages under the settings category, such as main settings, inference settings, account settings, and update settings.\n\n4. CurrentPagePath ObservableProperty: An ObservableCollection of PageViewModelBase, it uses the [ObservableProperty] attribute which indicates that changes to this collection will be observed by the UI for updates. It is initialized as an empty collection.\n\n5. CurrentPage ObservableProperty: It is a nullable Property of type PageViewModelBase using the [ObservableProperty] attribute, allowing binding and automatic updates in the UI when the current page changes.\n\n6. SettingsViewModel Constructor: The constructor accepts a ServiceManager of type ViewModelBase, which is presumably used for dependency injection to retrieve instances of various setting-related view models. It initializes the SubPages list with specific settings view models fetched from the ServiceManager and initially sets both the CurrentPage and CurrentPagePath with references to the first element of SubPages.\n\n7. OnCurrentPageChanged Partial Method: This method is invoked when the CurrentPage property changes. Depending on the actual type of the current page, it updates the CurrentPagePath list. When the current page is the MainSettingsViewModel, only that page is added to the path; otherwise, the path is cleared and replaced with the main settings page followed by the current page.\n\nThe use of 'partial' in the class and method declarations suggests that this code may be part of a partial class scheme, where the class's definition and functionality are split across multiple files.\n\nThe class makes efficient use of observable properties for dynamic UI updates and employs a constructor for dependency injection to construct subpage view models. The namespace usings at the top indicate dependencies on FluentIcons for symbolic representing settings and view-specific controls.\n\nPlease note that the class seems to be using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, common in applications that use XAML for UI definitions, such as WPF, UWP, or Avalonia.",

It is a representation of the view model responsible for managing the setup process during the first launch of an application, likely designed to work with the Avalonia UI framework.\n\nThis class is decorated with several attributes which imply how it is intended to be used:\n- `[View(typeof(FirstLaunchSetupWindow))]` suggests that this class is tied to a view named `FirstLaunchSetupWindow`.\n- `[ManagedService]` suggests the class should be managed as a service by the application's dependency injection system.\n- `[Singleton]` implies that only one instance of this class should be created during the application's lifecycle.\n\nThe class inherits from `ViewModelBase`, which is a common practice for keeping shared code and functionality required by all view models.\n\nThe class contains three private member variables which have been decorated with the `[ObservableProperty]` attribute. This attribute likely generates property change notifications that are essential for data binding in MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) applications.\n- `private bool eulaAccepted;` to hold the state of whether the End User License Agreement has been accepted.\n- `private string gpuInfoText = string.Empty;` to hold textual information regarding the GPU.\n- `private RefreshBadgeViewModel checkHardwareBadge`; an instance of `RefreshBadgeViewModel` which contains state and properties related to displaying a hardware status badge.\n\nAdditionally, a constructor `public FirstLaunchSetupViewModel()` is provided, which sets `CheckHardwareBadge.RefreshFunc` to `SetGpuInfo`, linking a delegate to a function that likely checks and sets GPU information.\n\nThe `SetGpuInfo` method is a private asynchronous method returning a `Task<bool>`. Inside this method:\n- GPU information is queried, simulating hardware query delay using `MinimumDelay`.\n- The GPU information gathered is processed to determine if an Nvidia GPU is present, and this status is updated in `GpuInfoText`.\n- The result is a boolean indicating if an Nvidia GPU is detected or not.\n\nFinally, the `public override void OnLoaded()` method overrides a base class method and is called when the related view is loaded. Within this method, it calls `base.OnLoaded()` to ensure that any necessary functionality in the base class is executed and then it initiates an asynchronous hardware check command using `CheckHardwareBadge.RefreshCommand.ExecuteAsync(null).SafeFireAndForget()` which suggests it's a fire-and-forget command that handles exceptions internally, avoiding unhandled exceptions.\n\nThis class would typically be used in a front-end application built with MVVM pattern where view models manage the state and the logic of the views.

Below is a description of each member of the Cultures class:\n\n- `Default`: This public member is a static property of type `CultureInfo` initialized with the \"en-US\" (English - United States) culture. Since it has a getter with no setter, it is read-only and serves as the default culture used by the application when no specific culture is set.\n\n- `Current`: Another public static property of type `CultureInfo?`, which is a nullable `CultureInfo`. It uses a getter to return the current culture, which is presumably set and retrieved from a `Resources` class not detailed in the provided snippet.\n\n- `SupportedCulturesByCode`: This is a public static read-only field initialized as a `Dictionary<string, CultureInfo>`. The dictionary contains pairs of culture codes and the respective `CultureInfo` objects representing the specific cultures supported by the application. For instance, \"en-US\" is paired with the `Default` culture and others like \"ja-JP\" or \"zh-Hant\" with their corresponding `CultureInfo` objects.\n\n- `SupportedCultures`: A public static property returning an `IReadOnlyList<CultureInfo>`. It leverages a `.ToImmutableList()` method call, implying that it constructs an immutable list of the values from the `SupportedCulturesByCode` dictionary. This list provides a read-only collection of the `CultureInfo` objects that are supported by the application.\n\n- `GetSupportedCultureOrDefault`: This method accepts a nullable string `cultureCode` and returns a `CultureInfo` object. If the provided `cultureCode` matches one of the keys in `SupportedCulturesByCode`, it returns the respective `CultureInfo` object; otherwise, it returns the `Default` culture. Its purpose is to fetch the `CultureInfo` object based on a culture code, defaulting if the code is not supported or is null.\n\n- `SetSupportedCultureOrDefault`: A public static method taking a nullable string `cultureCode` which attempts to set the application's current culture to one of the supported cultures by calling `TrySetSupportedCulture`. If unsuccessful, it falls back to setting the `Default` culture.\n\n- `TrySetSupportedCulture`: The method is overloaded twice\u2014one accepting a nullable string `cultureCode` and the other a nullable `CultureInfo?` `cultureInfo`. The string overload tries to find and set the application's current culture to one matching the given culture code from `SupportedCulturesByCode`. It returns a boolean indicating success or failure. If successful, it triggers an `OnCultureChanged` event from what appears to be an `EventManager` class, signaling that the culture has changed. The `CultureInfo?` overload converts the operation over to the string overload by using the `CultureInfo.Name` property.\n\nNote: The `[SuppressMessage]` attribute visible at the top indicates a declaration to ignore specific warnings from the ReSharper code analysis tool. Additionally, certain details like `Resources.Culture` and `EventManager.Instance.OnCultureChanged` imply dependencies on other parts of the application not included in the snippet, and as such their behaviors and definitions are assumed based on their usage contexts.",

This class is marked with an attribute `[Target(\"DataStoreLogger\")]`, designating it as a target within NLog's configuration system.\n\n### Fields\n\n- `_dataStore` is a private field of type `ILogDataStore?` that may contain a reference to an object that is responsible for storing the logged data.\n- `_config` is a private field of the type `DataStoreLoggerConfiguration?` which holds the configuration settings for this logger target. It is nullable to account for the possibility that configuration has not been provided at the time of field initialization.\n\n### Methods\n\n#### InitializeTarget\n\nThis protected method is an override of `InitializeTarget` from the `TargetWithLayout` class. It is responsible for any initialization logic specific to this logging target. It sets up the `_dataStore` to reference an instance of `LogDataStore` and initializes `_config` with a new instance of `DataStoreLoggerConfiguration`, unless a configuration is provided externally.\n\n#### Write\n\nThis protected method overrides the `Write` method of the `TargetWithLayout` class and is responsible for handling log events passed to this target. It performs several key actions:\n1. Casts the NLog 'LogLevel' enum to the corresponding `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel` (aliased as `MsLogLevel`) type.\n2. Formats the message using the provided layout.\n3. Tries to extract an 'EventId' from the properties of the log event. If it fails to find one, it uses the default `EventId` from the configuration, if it exists.\n4.

Uses the `_dataStore`, if available, to add the `LogModel` instance into the log data storage system.\n\nThe `Write` method also handles exception messaging and assigns a color based on the log level using the provided `_config` (assuming it is not null).\n\nThis class encapsulates the logic necessary to redirect log events from NLog into a structured data store, potentially allowing for more sophisticated log analysis and visualization within an application, such as a log viewer interface.

The use of `UIThread.Post` suggests operations that need to be performed on the UI thread, which is a common practice in UI frameworks to ensure thread safety.\n\nOverall, the `PackageInstallProgressItemViewModel` is tailored to manage the display of installation or modification progress for packages within an application, updating the user through a UI dialog on the status of such operations, and carrying out UI thread-safe updates and event handling.",

This class is designed to be consumed in environments where stability and error handling for file and directory operations are important, such as in a user interface framework like Avalonia.\n\nThe class has been decorated with the `SuppressMessage` attribute for ReSharper, instructing it to ignore the suggestion that members could be made private. This ensures that these methods can be called from outside the class, which is often necessary for extension methods.\n\nThere are two main members within the class, both of which are public static methods:\n\n1. `DeleteVerboseAsync` is an asynchronous Task-returning method, acting as an extension for DirectoryPath instances and allows for asynchronous deletion of a directory and its contents. This method accepts an optional ILogger object, which it uses to log warning messages. Deletion tasks are performed with a retry policy defined by the Polly library, which retries up to 3 times if an IOException occurs, using an exponential backoff strategy based on the attempt number. It encapsulates the execution of the synchronous `DeleteVerbose` method within a Task.Run to facilitate async execution.\n\n2. `DeleteVerbose` is a synchronous method that performs the actual deletion process. It uses a number of checks and operations to handle different scenarios safely:\n\n   - If the directory doesn't exist, the method terminates.\n   - If the directory is a symbolic link (junction point), it attempts to delete it non-recursively and logs the action if a logger is provided.\n   - Recursively calls itself for all subdirectories to ensure that all nested contents are properly deleted.\n   - Resets file attributes to Normal and deletes each file in the directory, providing error handling in case deletion fails.\n   - Attempts to delete the current directory non-recursively once all contents are cleared.\n\nBoth methods are equipped with exception handling to throw detailed IOExceptions if any of the file or directory deletions fail, ensuring that users of the class are made aware of any issues that occur during the deletion process.\"",

Its purpose is to locate a specific model in either a local database or a remote server using a file hash. It is adorned with the `[Singleton]` attribute, which typically indicates that this class is to be used as a singleton, meaning there should only be one instance of it throughout the application.\n\nIt includes several members:\n\n1. `Logger`: A private static readonly field of type `Logger` from `LogManager`, used to log messages for various levels of importance (e.g., Info, Warn). This logger is initialized to the logger of the current class.\n\n2. `liteDbContext`: A private readonly instance of `ILiteDbContext`. This field represents the local database context in which the application can perform data operations like finding models.\n\n3. `civitApi`: A private readonly instance of `ICivitApi`. This represents the API connection to Civit, an external service for model management.\n\n4. The constructor: It accepts instances of `ILiteDbContext` and `ICivitApi` which it uses to initialize the `liteDbContext` and `civitApi` fields, respectively. This is where the dependencies of the class are provided, usually through dependency injection.\n\n5. `LocalFindModel`: A public async method that returns a `Task<ModelSearchResult?>`. It accepts a string parameter `hashBlake3` representing the file hash. The method uses `liteDbContext` to find a model and its version from the local database. If found, it returns a tuple encapsulating the model details (`CivitModel`, `CivitModelVersion`, and `CivitFile`) in a `ModelSearchResult` struct.\n\n6. `RemoteFindModel`: A public async method that returns a `Task<ModelSearchResult?>`. Similar to `LocalFindModel`, it accepts a string `hashBlake3`. This method searches for the model using the Civit API. It logs relevant information and handles exceptions such as timeouts (`TaskCanceledException`), API exceptions (`ApiException`, including a 404 not found), and HTTP request exceptions (`HttpRequestException`). Depending on the outcome of the API call, it returns `ModelSearchResult` or `null`.\n\nAdditionally, there's:\n\n- `ModelSearchResult`: A `public record struct` that represents the result of a model search. It's a simple data structure that encapsulates a `CivitModel`, `CivitModelVersion`, and `CivitFile`, all of which are assumed to be types relevant to the domain of the application. This record struct is used as the return type of the search methods, conveniently grouping the relevant information about a model's search result.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that, since this is a high-level description, some specific implementation details (like the nature of the interfaces `ILiteDbContext` and `ICivitApi`, as well as the types `CivitModel`, `CivitModelVersion`, and `CivitFile`) are not extensively described and are assumed to be part of the application's domain model.",

    "detailed_description": "The `RefreshBadgeViewModel` class, is a partial class and a part of the `StabilityMatrix.Avalonia.ViewModels` namespace. It is a complex class that serves as the view model in an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for a user interface component that indicates a refreshing or loading state. This component might be displayed while data is being fetched or processed, and might show different symbols and colors based on the state of the operation (e.g., working, success, failed).\n\nThe class is decorated with attributes that suggest it is used within a framework which supports features like views, message suppression, dependency injection, and property management. For example, the `[View(typeof(RefreshBadge))]` attribute may associate the view model with a particular view.\n\nThe class extends `ViewModelBase`, indicating it is a type of view model with base functionality provided by the MVVM framework.\n\nHere are the key members of the `RefreshBadgeViewModel` class:\n\n1. `Logger`: a static readonly logger instance from an unspecified logging library, most likely NLog, used to log messages within the class.\n\n2. `WorkingToolTipText`, `SuccessToolTipText`, `InactiveToolTipText`, `FailToolTipText`: Public properties that store the tool tip text for different states, pre-initialized with default values.\n\n3. `InactiveIcon`, `SuccessIcon`, `FailIcon`: Public properties that hold different symbols to represent the various states, initialized with default values.\n\n4. `InactiveColorBrush`, `SuccessColorBrush`, `FailColorBrush`: Public properties that hold brushes representing different colors according to state, initialized with default theme colors.\n\n5. `RefreshFunc`: A public property of type `Func<Task<bool>>?`, which allows the user to assign an asynchronous function returning a boolean, which is used to perform the actual refreshing work.\n\n6. `state`: A private field of type `ProgressState`, which is maintained by the class to track the current state of the refresh operation. It is decorated with `[ObservableProperty]` and related attributes to notify changes in related properties, but its declaration is not shown.\n\n7. `IsWorking`: A public readonly property indicating if the current state is working which is deduced from the value of `state`.\n\n8. `ColorBrush`, `CurrentToolTip`, `Icon`: Public readonly properties that switch their return values based on the value of `state`. They depend on various public properties for tooltips, colors, and icons.\n\n9. `Refresh`: A method marked with `[RelayCommand]`, making it callable as a command, typically from the user interface. The method implementation logs the action, checks for a `null` `RefreshFunc`, and changes the `state` based on the result of calling `RefreshFunc`. Exceptions during the refresh process are caught, logged, and result in the `state` being set to failed.\n\nIt is important to note some things based on the available information:\n- Symbols like `Symbol`, `IBrush`, `Logger`, `ThemeColors`, and `ProgressState` are referenced but not defined within the class, meaning they are defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n- The `ObservableProperty`, `NotifyPropertyChangedFor`, and `RelayCommand` are likely custom attributes used for property change notifications and command binding within the MVVM framework.\n- Some properties and aspects of this view model are designed for binding to UI elements, allowing the view represented by this view model to update automatically when these properties change.\n\nLastly, the commented-out `Appearance` property suggests there may have been other features or properties earlier in the development that have since been deprecated or replaced with current implementations.",

It is marked as a `ManagedService` and as `Transient`, hinting that its lifetime management should be handled by a dependency injection framework and that it is created anew each time a request for the type is made. The class extends `LoadableViewModelBase`, making it part of a view model layer typically used in Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) application architectures, particularly for the user interface elements provided by the Avalonia UI framework.\n\nThe specific details of the `ControlNetCardViewModel` class members are as follows:\n\n- `ModuleKey`: A public constant string which presumably serves as a unique identifier within the module it is related to.\n  \n- `trackedDownloadService`: A private read-only field, likely used for managing download operations that need to be monitored or tracked.\n  \n- `settingsManager`: Another private read-only field, most likely used to interact with application settings.\n  \n- `vmFactory`: A private read-only field of type `ServiceManager<ViewModelBase>`, which seems to be a factory for creating instances of view models.\n\n- `selectedModel`: A private field of nullable type `HybridModelFile`, decorated with `[ObservableProperty]` and `[Required]` attributes. This suggests that the property changes will notify observers and that this field is mandatory.\n\n- `selectedPreprocessor`: Similar to the `selectedModel`, this is a private nullable field of the same type, also required and can notify its changes to observers.\n\n- `strength`: Another private field with its type as `double`, initialized to `1.0`. It's also decorated with `[ObservableProperty]`, `[Required]`, and `[Range(0d, 10d)]`, indicating that it is a mandatory field and must fall within the specified range.\n\n- `startPercent`: A private double field, also observable and required, but with a range attribute that restricts it between 0 to 1.\n\n- `endPercent`: Similar to `startPercent`, this is a private, observable, required field with a range of 0 to 1 and is initialized to `1.0`.\n\n- `SelectImageCardViewModel`: A public property of type `SelectImageCardViewModel`. It does not have a setter, so it seems to be a read-only property that is likely initialized within the constructor or by dependency injection.\n\n- `ClientManager`: A public property of type `IInferenceClientManager`. This property's purpose appears to be managing clients that perform inference operations.\n\nThe class also includes a constructor with parameters to set its private fields and initialize its two public properties. These dependencies are presumably provided by some sort of inversion of control container.\n\nThere are method decorations within the class as well:\n\n- `[RelayCommand]`: This attributes a method named `RemoteDownload`, indicating that it is an asynchronous task meant to be executed as a command, possibly from the UI. \n\nThe `RemoteDownload` method itself manages the logic for downloading a file remotely, handling the download through a dialog confirmation process, and tracking the download process.\n\nThe class interacts with several external components\uff0dfor instance, utilizing `settingsManager` to get the directory for models, using the `trackedDownloadService` for initiating downloads, and calling the `EventManager.Instance.OnToggleProgressFlyout()` method, which implies some interaction with the UI or application status notifications.\n\nAll of this indicates that `ControlNetCardViewModel` is an important component in the application's architecture, particularly for managing the network-related operations and interfacing with the UI for tasks related to downloading and setting up models used for inference operations.",

It is likely part of an application that deals with upscaling operations, where upscaling refers to increasing the resolution or quality of digital content, such as images or videos.\n\n- This class extends `LoadableViewModelBase`, suggesting it is a ViewModel in a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, likely used for data binding to a user interface.\n\n- `[View(typeof(UpscalerCard))]` indicates this ViewModel is associated with a View component named `UpscalerCard`.\n\n- `[ManagedService]` and `[Transient]` attributes likely denote how instances of this ViewModel are managed within an IoC (Inversion of Control) container, with \"Transient\" probably meaning that a new instance is created every time it is requested.\n\n- The class contains a constant string `ModuleKey` with the value \"Upscaler\", which might represent a unique identifier or key related to this module or feature within the application.\n\n- The class has four private readonly fields representing various services that it depends on:\n  - `notificationService` (INotificationService) is presumably used to display notifications or alerts to the user.\n  - `trackedDownloadService` (ITrackedDownloadService) likely manages downloads while allowing their progress to be tracked.\n  - `settingsManager` (ISettingsManager) is used to manipulate application settings, such as paths or preferences.\n  - `vmFactory` (ServiceManager<ViewModelBase>) perhaps provides a way to instantiate other ViewModels.\n\n- Two `[ObservableProperty]` attributes decorate private fields, which are part of the ViewModel's state that can change and notify the View:\n  - `scale` (double) holds a value representing the scale factor for the upscaling operation.\n  - `selectedUpscaler` (ComfyUpscaler?) is a nullable type that references the currently selected upscaling algorithm or option.\n\n- `ClientManager` (IInferenceClientManager) is a public property with a getter only, suggesting it is set during construction and not meant to be changed afterward. It likely represents a service for managing client operations related to inference tasks.\n\n- The constructor takes instances of the services mentioned above as parameters and initializes the properties with these instances. This indicates the class is using constructor injection for its dependencies.\n\n- `[RelayCommand]` attribute indicates that `RemoteDownload` (a private method) is a command that can be bound to a user interface element, like a button. It is an asynchronous Task method that takes an optional `ComfyUpscaler` parameter and appears to manage the process of remotely downloading resources related to the selected upscaler.\n\n- The `LoadStateFromJsonObject` method overrides a base class method to deserialize state from a `JsonObject`. This is likely part of the ViewModel loading its state perhaps when the application starts or the View is navigated to.\n\n- Similarly, the `SaveStateToJsonObject` method serializes the ViewModel's state to a `JsonObject`, likely for persistence or state sharing purposes.\n\n- `EventManager.Instance.OnToggleProgressFlyout()` line within `RemoteDownload` suggests that this class can trigger a UI element to reflect the progress of operations, such as downloads.\n\nThe fields, properties, methods, and attributes all suggest that `UpscalerCardViewModel` is a robust ViewModel meant to handle a variety of tasks related to upscaling operations within an application, such as managing user selections, initiating and tracking downloads, and persisting state across sessions. It is designed to be used with a specific User Interface and is integrated with a broader ecosystem of services and components, including event handling and a dependency injection framework.",

It uses a switch expression to provide user-friendly names for the different upscaler types.\n\nProperty: `DisplayName`\nThe `DisplayName` provides a user-friendly name for the upscaling technique by either using a lookup in `ConvertDict` or stripping file extensions from the name, based on upscaler type.\n\nProperty: `ShortDisplayName`\nThe `ShortDisplayName` is similar to `DisplayName`, but always strips file extensions from the name unless it is of type `Latent`.\n\nStatic Member: `DefaultDownloadableModels`\nThe `DefaultDownloadableModels` property is a read-only list of default downloadable models initialized using `RemoteModels.Upscalers` and the `FromDownloadable` method.\n\nNested Class: `NameTypeEqualityComparer`\nA private sealed class `NameTypeEqualityComparer` implements the `IEqualityComparer<ComfyUpscaler>` interface to provide custom comparison logic, essentially checking for equality based on both `Name` and `Type`.\n\nStatic Member: `Comparer`\nThe `Comparer` is a static, read-only property that returns an instance of `NameTypeEqualityComparer`, allowing comparison of two `ComfyUpscaler` instances based on their names and types.\n\nJsonIgnore Attributes:\nThe `[JsonIgnore]` attribute is applied to specific properties (`DisplayType`, `DisplayName`, `ShortDisplayName`) to exclude them from the JSON serialization process, which is common when there is no need to persist computed properties or if data normalization is needed before serialization.\n\nMemberNotNullWhen Attribute:\nThe attribute `[MemberNotNullWhen(true, nameof(DownloadableResource))]` makes a nullable reference type field non-null based on the provided boolean member, adding safety and clarity to nullability contracts in codebases adopting C# 8.0 and its nullable reference types feature.\n\nIn summary, the `ComfyUpscaler` record struct encapsulates the concept of an upscaling technique in a software application, providing static presets, conversion utilities, and properties that represent an upscaler's metadata, along with mechanisms for type comparisons and JSON serialization configuration.\"",

It is assumed to serve as a mock implementation for managing inferences in a client.\n\nHere are the details of each member of this class:\n\n1. `Client`: A nullable property of type `ComfyClient` which holds a reference to an inference client object. It's public allowing consumers to get or set the associated client.\n\n2. `Models`, `VaeModels`, `ControlNetModels`, `Samplers`, `Upscalers`, `Schedulers`: These are properties representing collections of different types (`HybridModelFile`, `ComfySampler`, `ComfyUpscaler`, `ComfyScheduler`). They are all of type `IObservableCollection<T>`, which implies they support collection-changed notifications to update the UI in an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. Each collection is initialized with an `ObservableCollectionExtended<T>`, which likely extends the capabilities of a standard `ObservableCollection<T>`. The `Models` collection is populated in the constructor with a couple of remote hybrid model files.\n\n3. `isConnected` and `isConnecting`: These are private fields, likely intended to track the state of the connection. They are decorated with `[ObservableProperty]` and `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor(nameof(CanUserConnect))]` attributes, which probably generate property-changed notifications when these fields' values are set, thus auto-generating properties for these fields per the MVVM pattern.\n\n4. `CanUserConnect` and `CanUserDisconnect`: Computed read-only properties which determine whether a user can initiate a connection or disconnect based on the status of `IsConnected` and `IsConnecting`. Their returning values are simple boolean expressions based on the values of these two properties.\n\n5. `MockInferenceClientManager()`: The default constructor which populates the `Models` collection with some preset model files.\n\n6. `CopyImageToInputAsync`, `UploadInputImageAsync`, and `WriteImageToInputAsync`: These public methods are intended to handle various tasks related to image processing in an asynchronous manner. Each takes a cancellation token and returns a completed task, suggesting that the current implementation is a placeholder that doesn't perform any actual work. \n\n7. `ConnectAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`: An asynchronous method which simulates the process of connecting to a service. This method first sets `IsConnecting` to true, waits for 5 seconds (presumably to simulate a connection delay), then sets `IsConnecting` to false and `IsConnected` to true.\n\n8. `ConnectAsync(PackagePair packagePair, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`: Another overload of the `ConnectAsync` method that takes a `PackagePair` argument. However, the method body suggests it is not implemented and only returns a completed task.\n\n9. `CloseAsync()`: This method presumably simulates disconnection by setting `IsConnected` to false and returns a completed task.\n\n10. `Dispose()`: Implements the `IDisposable` interface, allowing instances of this class to be disposed of properly, where it suppresses finalization with the `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` method, suggesting that there are no unmanaged resources to clean up, or this method's logic is a placeholder until a more complete implementation is provided. \n\nThis mock implementation is useful for testing and design-time scenarios where the actual client logic is not required or not available.

Specifically, `View` and `ManagedService` annotations might indicate that the class is associated with a View in a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern and should be handled by a service management system, respectively.

It is also excluded from JSON serialization.\n\n4. `public IReadOnlyList<Type> AvailableModules { get; set; }`\n   A public property representing a read-only list of `Type` objects. It is the list of available modules that users can create, and it's initialized with an empty array of `Type`. This property isn't serialized into JSON.\n\n5. `public IReadOnlyList<Type> DefaultModules { get; set; }`\n   Similar to `AvailableModules`, this property holds a read-only list of `Type` objects representing default modules, initialized with an empty array. This is a subset of `AvailableModules` and is not included in JSON serialization.\n\n6. `public StackEditableCardViewModel(ServiceManager<ViewModelBase> vmFactory)`\n   This is the public constructor that takes a `ServiceManager<ViewModelBase>` argument. It passes this argument to the base class constructor and retains a copy in a private field. \n\n7. `public void InitializeDefaults()`\n   A public method that initializes the `Cards` collection property from the `StackViewModelBase` class by creating new instances of the types contained within the `DefaultModules` list.\n\n8. `partial void OnIsEditEnabledChanged(bool value)`\n   A partial method called when the `IsEditEnabled` property changes. Its likely implementation is to propagate the edit state to children in the `Cards` collection that are instances of `StackExpanderViewModel`.\n\n9. `protected override void OnCardAdded(LoadableViewModelBase item)`\n   This protected method overrides a method in the base class and is called when a new card is added. If the new card is a `StackExpanderViewModel`, the edit state inherited from the current model is applied to it.\n\n10. `public T AddModule<T>() where T : ModuleBase`\n    A public generic method to add a module of type `T` where `T` must inherit from `ModuleBase`. The module is created via the service manager (`vmFactory`), added to the `Cards` collection, and then returned.\n\n11. `public T AddModule<T>(Action<T> initializer) where T : ModuleBase`\n    Overload of the `AddModule` method that also accepts an `Action<T>`. The action allows for the caller to initialize the module in some way before it's added to the collection.\n\n12. `[RelayCommand] private void AddModule(Type type)`\n    A private method marked with the `RelayCommand` attribute, suggesting that it's intended to be bound to a command object for use in XAML-based UI frameworks. The method adds a module given a `Type` object if that type is a subclass of `ModuleBase`.

This logger is obtained from the current class context using `LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger()` method call.\n\n2. **VerifyFlowExceptionsToTaskSchedulerEnabled (private static method)**:\n   - This is a static helper method used internally to verify if a given `IAsyncRelayCommand` instance has been created with the `FlowExceptionsToTaskScheduler` option enabled. If it's not enabled, the method throws an `ArgumentException` to ensure that the error handling mechanism provided by other methods will behave as expected.\n\n3. **WithErrorHandler (public static method)**:\n   - This is a generic extension method that attaches an error handler to an `IAsyncRelayCommand` object. The error handler will be an action taking an `Exception` object parameter and will be invoked when an exception occurs during command execution. If the command was not created with the `FlowExceptionsToTaskScheduler` option enabled, the method throws an `ArgumentException`.\n\n4. **WithConditionalErrorHandler (public static method)**:\n   - This generic extension method is conditionally compiled, with one variant for `DEBUG` mode that attaches an error handler to an `IAsyncRelayCommand` and throws an exception if one occurs, and another variant for non-`DEBUG` modes that delegates to `WithErrorHandler` to attach an error handler without throwing. This method also checks if the `FlowExceptionsToTaskScheduler` option is enabled, throwing an `ArgumentException` if it's not.\n\n5. **WithNotificationErrorHandler (public static method)**:\n   - A generic extension method that attaches an error handler to an `IAsyncRelayCommand` which logs the error using the `Logger` and shows a persistent notification using the provided `INotificationService`. The log level for logging the error can be provided as an argument and defaults to `LogLevel.Error`. Similar to the other methods, it requires that the `FlowExceptionsToTaskScheduler` option be enabled, throwing an `ArgumentException` if not.\n\n6. **WithConditionalNotificationErrorHandler (public static method)**:\n   - Similar to `WithNotificationErrorHandler`, this is a generic extension method that logs an error and shows a notification using the provided `INotificationService`. If in `DEBUG` mode, errors are thrown. If in another build mode, it uses `WithNotificationErrorHandler` for attaching an error handler. It requires the `FlowExceptionsToTaskScheduler` option to be enabled, or it throws an `ArgumentException`.\n\nThese extension methods are designed to be called on `IAsyncRelayCommand` objects, often used for MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern commands in applications that require asynchronous operations and proper handling of exceptions resulting from the execution of these commands.\n",

    "detailed_description": "The `CompletionData` class, part of the `StabilityMatrix.Avalonia.Controls.CodeCompletion` namespace, implements the `ICompletionData` interface and is used to provide entries in the completion window of AvaloniaEdit, an extensible text editor component for the Avalonia UI framework. Below are details about each member of the `CompletionData` class:\n\n- `Text`: A property of type `string` that holds the text of the completion data. This text is what will be shown to the user and inserted when the completion is selected.\n\n- `Description`: An optional property of type `string?` (nullable string) that can be used to hold a description of the completion data, providing additional context or information about the completion entry.\n\n- `ImageSource`: An optional property of type `ImageSource?` (nullable `ImageSource`) used to associate an image with the completion data. This could be displayed alongside the text in the completion list.\n\n- `ImageTitle`: An optional property of type `string?` that provides a title for the associated `ImageSource`.\n\n- `ImageSubtitle`: An optional property of type `string?` that provides a subtitle for the associated `ImageSource`.\n\n- `Icon`: An optional property of type `IconData?` (nullable `IconData`) that represents an icon to be displayed in the completion list. Like `ImageSource`, this enhances the visual representation of the completion data.\n\n- `_textInlines`: A private field of type `InlineCollection?` that may contain formatted `Inline` elements which are used to construct the visual representation of the `Text` string in the completion window.\n\n- `TextInlines`: A read-only property that returns the `InlineCollection`. If `_textInlines` is `null`, it calls `CreateInlines()` to create and return a new `InlineCollection`.\n\n- `Priority`: An optional property of type `double` that indicates the priority of the completion data entry. Entries with a higher priority might be shown before others.\n\nThe `CompletionData` class has the following methods:\n\n- `CompletionData`: A constructor that initializes a new instance of the `CompletionData` class using the given `text`.\n\n- `CreateInlines`: A private method responsible for creating an `InlineCollection` from the `Text` property. This allows for rich formatting of the completion text.\n\n- `Complete`: A method that replaces text in the `TextArea` with the content of the `Text` property when a completion is selected. If a `prepareText` function is provided, it can modify the text before inserting it. The `eventArgs.AppendText` allows for additional text to be appended after the completion.\n\n- `UpdateCharHighlighting`: A method that updates the character highlighting of the inline elements based on the given `searchText`. Matching characters in the `searchText` are highlighted with a different foreground color.\n\n- `ResetCharHighlighting`: A method that resets all character highlighting to the default color.\n\nThe `CompletionData` class enhances the usability of the AvaloniaEdit control by providing a customizable and interactive completion interface. The class's methods and properties allow for a rich display of completion data with text, images, and colors. The optional descriptions, images, and priorities can be employed to create a pleasant and effective auto-complete experience for end-users.",

This class serves as the base for view models that maintain a stack-like collection of `LoadableViewModelBase` objects represented as cards.\n\nBelow is the detailed description of each member of the `StackViewModelBase` class:\n\n1. **Private Fields:**\n   - `vmFactory`: A private readonly field of the type `ServiceManager<ViewModelBase>` that is likely used for creating instances of `ViewModelBase`.\n\n2. **Public Properties:**\n   - `Cards`: An `AdvancedObservableList<LoadableViewModelBase>` that stores a collection of `LoadableViewModelBase` objects. This list observes changes and can notify when modifications happen.\n\n3. **Constructor:**\n   - `protected StackViewModelBase(ServiceManager<ViewModelBase> vmFactory)`: A protected constructor that takes a `vmFactory` parameter and initializes the corresponding field. It also attaches an event handler to the `CollectionChanged` event of `Cards`.\n\n4. **Methods:**\n   - `public virtual void OnContainerIndexChanged(int value)`: A virtual method that can be overridden by derived classes to perform actions when the container's index changes.\n   - `protected virtual void OnCardAdded(LoadableViewModelBase item)`: A virtual method used internally to notify whenever a new card is added.\n   - `public void AddCards(params LoadableViewModelBase[] cards)`: An overloaded method allowing multiple cards to be added to the `Cards` collection.\n   - `public void AddCards(IEnumerable<LoadableViewModelBase> cards)`: Adds a range of `LoadableViewModelBase` objects to the `Cards` collection and raises the `CardAdded` event.\n   - `public StackViewModelBase WithCards(IEnumerable<LoadableViewModelBase> cards)`: Adds cards and then returns the current instance of the `StackViewModelBase` enabling method chaining.\n   - `public T GetCard<T>(int index = 0)`: Retrieves a card of a specified type `T` from the `Cards` collection at the given index. Throws an exception if the card is not found.\n   - `public void Clear()`: Clears all the cards from the `Cards` collection.\n\n5. **Events:**\n   - `public event EventHandler<LoadableViewModelBase>? CardAdded`: An event that clients can subscribe to which is raised whenever a card is added to the `Cards` collection.\n\n6. **Override Methods:**\n   - `public override void LoadStateFromJsonObject(JsonObject state)`: An override of `LoadableViewModelBase` method that loads the state of `StackViewModelBase` from a JSON object. It uses the `vmFactory` to instantiate cards based on the JSON data.\n   - `public override JsonObject SaveStateToJsonObject()`: An override of the `LoadableViewModelBase` method that saves the state of the `StackViewModelBase` to a JSON object. It records the types associated with the cards and constructs a JSON array to represent the stack's contents.\n\nIn summary, the `StackViewModelBase` class manages a dynamic collection of view models (`LoadableViewModelBase`).

It also enables the preview overlay.\n\n- `private void OnImageSourcesItemsChanged(...)`: A private method that is an event handler for changes in the `imageSources` collection. It adjusts the `SelectedImageIndex` and raises property change notifications for navigation and multiple images indicators.\n\n- `[RelayCommand] private async Task FlyoutCopy(IImage? image)`: A command method marked with `[RelayCommand]` which, when executed, attempts to copy an image to the clipboard.\n\n- `[RelayCommand] private async Task FlyoutPreview(IImage? image)`: A command method used to open a preview of the selected image using an `ImageViewerViewModel` and a dialog component.\n\nThe usage of `[ObservableProperty]`, `[RelayCommand]`, and `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor]` suggests that this class relies on a robust MVVM framework that automates much of the change notification and command binding commonly required in such applications. The `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor]` attribute specifically indicates that changes to the `selectedImageIndex` property should also notify observers of changes to the `CanNavigateBack` and `CanNavigateForward` properties.

    "detailed_description": "The `RemoteModels` class is a static class within the `StabilityMatrix.Core.Helper` namespace. Since it is a static class, it does not allow instance creation and acts as a container for static members, which include methods and properties. The class works as a repository or service that provides access to various model resources, particularly focusing on AI-related model upscalers and control networks. Here is a detailed description of each member within the `RemoteModels` class:\n\n1. `UpscalersRoot`: This is a static read-only property of type `Uri` that stores the base URI for the upscalers hosted on huggingface.co. It remains private to the class and is the root URL from which other upscalers' URLs are constructed.\n\n2. `UpscalersRootMain`: Similar to `UpscalersRoot`, this is also a static read-only property of type `Uri`. This property extends `UpscalersRoot` by appending \"blob/main/\" to the end, pointing towards the main branch of the repository for upscaler files.\n\n3. `Upscalers`: This is a public static read-only property that returns an `IReadOnlyList<RemoteResource>`. It contains an array of `RemoteResource` objects, where each `RemoteResource` represents the metadata of an upscaling model file, such as its URL, SHA256 hash, information URL, author, license type, license URL, and context type. The property enables read-only access to a predefined list of upscaler resources.\n\n4. `ControlNetRoot`: This is a static read-only property of type `Uri` similar to `UpscalersRoot`, but it refers to the root URL for control networks, also hosted on huggingface.co.\n\n5. `ControlNetCommon`: This method is private and static, taking in two string parameters, `path` and `sha256`. It is a helper method that constructs a `RemoteResource` object for a control network model by concatenating a given path with a commit identifier to `ControlNetRoot` and by associating the provided SHA256 hash. This method is likely used internally by the `RemoteModels` class to create `RemoteResource` objects for control network files.\n\n6. `ControlNets`: Like `Upscalers`, this is a public static read-only property of type `IReadOnlyList<RemoteResource>` that provides access to control network resources. It uses the `ControlNetCommon` method to create each `RemoteResource` in the list, providing the path and SHA256 hash for each resource.\n\n7. `ControlNetModels`: This public static read-only property returns an `IReadOnlyList<HybridModelFile>`. It essentially converts each `RemoteResource` from the `ControlNets` list into a `HybridModelFile` object using the `FromDownloadable` method, which is likely a factory method for creating `HybridModelFile` instances from downloadable resources. The results are stored as an immutable array, providing a list of control net models ready for use.\n\nNote: In the provided code, some associated classes like `RemoteResource`, `SharedFolderType`, and `HybridModelFile` are mentioned, but their specific implementation details are not given. These classes are presumably part of the same system and are used to encapsulate data about the remote resources and the models. Also, some extension methods like `Append` and `Select` indicate additional functionality that is not part of the standard .NET library, so they are likely custom extensions provided in the same or related namespace.",

    "detailed_description": "The class `InferenceImageUpscaleViewModel` in the `StabilityMatrix.Avalonia.ViewModels.Inference` namespace is an extended ViewModel that is specialized for the inference of image upscaling within an Avalonia application. The class is decorated with several custom attributes indicating how it should behave within the environment, such as `[View]` which likely associates the ViewModel with a View, and attributes like `[DynamicallyAccessedMembers]` and `[ManagedService]` which are used for reflection control and dependency injection, respectively. The `[Transient]` attribute likely indicates that new instances of the ViewModel are created on-demand rather than shared.\n\nHere are the details of each member:\n\n- `Logger`: A private static readonly field of the Logger type from NLog library assigned with the class-level logger for logging purposes.\n\n- `notificationService`: A private readonly field holding a reference to an instance of a service responsible for user notifications.\n\n- `StackCardViewModel`: A public read-only property of type `StackCardViewModel`, which does not support JSON serialization due to `[JsonIgnore]`. It probably represents a collection of UI elements stacked together like cards.\n\n- `UpscalerCardViewModel`: A public read-only property of type `UpscalerCardViewModel`, which will be serialized with the JSON property name \"Upscaler\". It likely represents the UI controls and logic for image upscaling operations.\n\n- `SharpenCardViewModel`: A public read-only property of type `SharpenCardViewModel`, serialized with JSON property name \"Sharpen\". This represents controls for adjusting image sharpness.\n\n- `SelectImageCardViewModel`: A public read-only property of type `SelectImageCardViewModel`, serialized with JSON property name \"SelectImage\". This is for selecting images to process.\n\n- `IsUpscaleEnabled`: A public property that gets or sets the enabled state of the image upscaling operation, interacting with the corresponding property in a `StackExpanderViewModel`.\n\n- `IsSharpenEnabled`: Similar to `IsUpscaleEnabled`, this property manages whether the sharpening operation is enabled by interacting with a `StackExpanderViewModel`.\n\n- Constructor: It initializes the ViewModel with dependencies such as `INotificationService`, `IInferenceClientManager`, `ISettingsManager`, and `ServiceManager<ViewModelBase>`. It uses a factory pattern through the `vmFactory` argument to create the view models for the card properties and sets up the `StackCardViewModel` with the necessary cards.\n\n- `GetInputImages`: An override-protected method that yields images selected by the user for processing, supplied by `SelectImageCardViewModel`.\n\n- `BuildPrompt`: Another override-protected method that is abstract in the base class and must be implemented here. It builds a prompt or command chain to apply image processing steps based on the state of the ViewModel.\n\n- `GenerateImageImpl`: An override-protected async task that is responsible for generating the upscaled image, it checks client connection, handles image uploading, constructs prompts, and executes image generation using provided overrides. The method communicates with the notification service to alert the user in case of issues and carries out the upscaling operation by calling the appropriate methods on the client manager.\n\nIn summary, `InferenceImageUpscaleViewModel` acts as a bridge between the View for image upscaling and the underlying business logic or services required for processing images with steps such as upscaling and sharpening, it handles user input, validation, notifying the user, and coordinating the processing of images.",

    "detailed_description": "The public class FileNameFormatProvider is a partial class defined in the StabilityMatrix.Avalonia.Models.Inference namespace. It is primarily concerned with generating and validating filename formats based on a set of predefined variables or custom substitutions. It uses a dictionary where keys are variable names and values are functions that return the variable's value as a string.\n\nHere's a detailed look at each member of the FileNameFormatProvider class:\n\n- `public GenerationParameters? GenerationParameters { get; init; }`: An optional property of type `GenerationParameters` which can be initialized upon object creation and holds the parameters related to file name generation.\n\n- `public InferenceProjectType? ProjectType { get; init; }`: This optional property represents the project type as an enum `InferenceProjectType`, and is initially settable.\n\n- `public string? ProjectName { get; init; }`: A nullable property to hold the project name, which is initially settable.\n\n- `private Dictionary<string, Func<string?>>? _substitutions;`: A private dictionary field that holds a mapping of variable names to functions that return their respective value as a string. It's initialized as null.\n\n- `public Dictionary<string, Func<string?>> Substitutions`: A public getter property that lazily instantiates the `_substitutions` dictionary if it hasn't already been created. The dictionary uses keys that are variable names and the functions return respective variable values as strings. Various parameters of the `GenerationParameters`, as well as properties such as `ProjectType` and `ProjectName`, are used to populate the dictionary.\n\n- `public ValidationResult Validate(string format)`: This method is used to validate a provided format string against the dictionary of substitutions. If an unknown variable is detected in the format, a `DataValidationException` is thrown. It uses regular expressions to extract variables from the format string and checks whether they are present in the `Substitutions` dictionary.\n\n- `public IEnumerable<FileNameFormatPart> GetParts(string template)`: This method breaks down a given filename template into parts, categorizing them into variables (which can be evaluated to get their values) or constants. It returns a list of `FileNameFormatPart` objects representing different sections of the file name format. These parts are assembled based on matches found by the `BracketRegex`.\n\n- `public static FileNameFormatProvider GetSample()`: A method that returns a sample FileNameFormatProvider object, configured with sample data for UI preview purposes.\n\n- `private static (string Variable, Slice? Slice) ExtractVariableAndSlice(string combined)`: A utility method that extracts a variable name and a slicing instruction (if present) from a string. The slicing instruction is used to select a subset of the variable's value.\n\n- `private static partial Regex BracketRegex()`: A partial method decorated with `GeneratedRegex` attribute to generate a regex that matches contents within braces (`{}`), identifying variable names in the format string.\n\n- `private static partial Regex IndexRegex()`: Another partial method with `GeneratedRegex` attribute, representing a Python-like array index pattern. This pattern is used to slice variable values if requested in the template.\n\n- `private record Slice(int? Start, int? End, int? Step)`: An inner record type that represents a slice of indices, similar to Python's list slicing syntax. It's utilized to specify which part of a variable's value should be included in the file name format.\n\nThe FileNameFormatProvider class would likely be used to handle dynamic file name generation in a software application, where file names may need to contain information derived from the software's state or the project it's working on, and validate the correctness of a format string provided by the user.",

It is responsible for the logic behind a one-click installation process in an Avalonia-based application for installing packages. It inherits from `ContentDialogViewModelBase` and is adorned with a `ManagedService` attribute that likely denotes registration for dependency injection, and a `Transient` lifecycle meaning a new instance is created each time it's requested. This class also uses partial class functionality, indicating that its definition may be split across multiple files.\n\nThe class has a mixture of private fields, constants, observable properties, commands, and methods that work together to facilitate the installation of packages. Here\u2019s an in-depth look at the members:\n\n- **Private Fields:** The class has several private readonly fields that store services provided by dependency injection, including `settingsManager`, `packageFactory`, `prerequisiteHelper`, `logger`, `pyRunner`, and `navigationService`. These services are used for managing settings, creating packages, checking prerequisites, logging, running Python scripts, and navigation within the application, respectively.\n\n- **Constants:** `DefaultPackageName` is a string constant that sets a default package name.\n\n- **Observable Properties:** These properties are annotated with the `[ObservableProperty]` attribute, hinting at a code generator for INotifyPropertyChanged implementation. Changes to these properties can automatically notify the UI to update. Properties include:\n  - `headerText`, `subHeaderText`, `subSubHeaderText`: Strings for UI text display.\n  - `showInstallButton`, `isIndeterminate`, `showIncompatiblePackages`: Booleans for UI state control.\n  - `allPackages`: An `ObservableCollection` of `BasePackage` objects representing the available packages for installation.\n  - `selectedPackage`: A `BasePackage` object representing the currently selected package.\n  - `oneClickInstallProgress`: An `int` indicating the progress of the installation.\n  - `isInferenceInstall`: A `bool` flag.\n\n- **Computed Property:**\n  - `IsProgressBarVisible`: A boolean computed property that returns true if there's any progress or the progress bar is in indeterminate state.\n\n- **Constructor:** The constructor receives all the necessary services via parameters, assigns them to the private fields, and initializes the UI-related properties and package lists. It filters the available packages based on conditions set by the package factory and pre-selects a package for installation.\n\n- **Commands:** Annotated with the `[RelayCommand]` attribute, indicating they are MVVM commands that can be bound to from XAML. These include:\n  - `Install`: Asynchronous method to initiate the installation process.\n  - `ToggleAdvancedMode`: A task method to switch to an advanced mode interface.\n  - `InstallComfyForInference`: An asynchronous method to install a specific package designed for inference (\"ComfyUI\").\n\n- **Private Methods:**\n  - `DoInstall`: Asynchronous method to handle the complete process of installation, including steps like setting up the environment, downloading the package, installing, and cleaning up.\n  - `OnShowIncompatiblePackagesChanged`: A partial method invoked when the `showIncompatiblePackages` property changes. It updates the available package list based on the compatibility filter.\n\nThis ViewModel is an example of the MVVM pattern with heavy use of async operations and encapsulated logic for package installation.

    "detailed_description": "The `ImageFolderCardViewModel` class, is a partial class, contained within the `StabilityMatrix.Avalonia.ViewModels.Inference` namespace. It inherits from `ViewModelBase`, and it is intended to manage and display a collection of local image files in an image folder view. This class leverages various services including logging, image indexing, settings management, and notification services to facilitate its functionalities.\n\n**Attributes:**\n- **View:** Denotes that this class has an associated view indicated by the `ImageFolderCard` type.\n- **ManagedService:** Marks class as a managed service which can be instantiated and managed by a Dependency Injection container.\n- **Transient:** Indicates that this class should be created as a new instance every time it is requested from the service container.\n\n**Private Fields:**\n- `logger`: An instance of `ILogger<ImageFolderCardViewModel>` to log information, warnings, or errors.\n- `imageIndexService`: An instance of `IImageIndexService` to handle operations on the index of image files.\n- `settingsManager`: An instance of `ISettingsManager` which is responsible for managing application settings.\n- `notificationService`: An instance of `INotificationService` to show notifications to the user.\n\n**Public Properties:**\n- `LocalImages`: A collection of `LocalImageFile` objects, backed by an `ObservableCollectionExtended`, which represents the set of local images available in the view.\n- `SearchQuery`: A nullable string that holds the search term to filter images in the view. This property is marked with `[ObservableProperty]` which generates boilerplate for property change notifications.\n- `ImageSize`: A `Size` object that represents the desired size of images. This property is initially set to 150x190 and is also marked with `[ObservableProperty]`.\n\n**Constructor:**\nThe `ImageFolderCardViewModel` constructor takes instances of the aforementioned services, assigns them to its fields, and sets up reactive filtering, sorting, and binding of the image collection against search queries. It also initializes delayed application settings manipulation.\n\n**Methods:**\n- `OnLoadedAsync()`: An overridden asynchronous method that is called when the ViewModel is loaded. It updates the `ImageSize` property with the settings from `settingsManager` and triggers the `imageIndexService` to refresh the index for all collections.\n- `SearchPredicate(...)`: A static method that determines if an `LocalImageFile` matches the search criteria given by `query`.\n\n**Command Methods:**\n- `OnImageClick(...)`: An asynchronous command method that handles image click events to display a preview of the clicked image.\n- `OnImageDelete(...)`: An asynchronous command method that deletes the selected image file when its associated delete button is clicked.\n- `OnImageCopy(...)`: An asynchronous command method that copies the file path of the selected image to the system clipboard.\n- `OnImageOpen(...)`: An asynchronous command method that opens the file browser at the location of the selected image.\n- `OnImageExportPng(...)`, `OnImageExportPngWithMetadata(...)`, `OnImageExportJpeg(...)`, `OnImageExportWebp(...)`: Asynchronous command methods that handle the exporting of selected images to various formats, optionally with metadata.\n\n**Private Helper Methods:**\n- `GetImagePathIfExists(...)`: A helper method that checks if an image file exists at the location specified by a `LocalImageFile` item, and performs cleaning actions if the file does not exist.\n- `ImageExportImpl(...)`: An internal helper method that handles the actual export of an image to the specified format and manages metadata inclusion.\n\n**RelayCommand Attributes and Observables:**\nSeveral methods are decorated with `[RelayCommand]` attributes which indicate they are bound to commands in the associated view, enabling interaction with UI elements.\n\nThe `ImageFolderCardViewModel` employs a mix of `System.Reactive.Linq` observables for reactive programming, `Tasks` for asynchronous operations, and complex interaction patterns with UI elements, leveraging several helper classes and external libraries to handle file operations, image processing, and user interaction.\n\n*Note: The original input provided contains small syntax issues throughout the code. Some of these potential issues include a syntax oversight in `namespace CustomNumeric {` (there should not be `()` after the class name `Complex`), and missing using directives or type definitions (e.g., necessary for `ObservableCollectionExtended`, `RelayCommand`, `ProcessRunner`, `INotificationService`, etc.). Assuming that these are unintended and should not affect the description of the `ImageFolderCardViewModel`, the description was provided in context.*",

This class is a ViewModel for an ImageFolderCard and is responsible for handling the logic related to image folders. The class is initialized with several services including ILogger, IImageIndexService, ISettingsManager, and INotificationService. It also sets up the image search and settings relay. \n\nThe class contains a method 'SearchPredicate' that determines if a file matches the search query. The 'OnLoadedAsync' method refreshes the image index when the ViewModel is loaded. The 'GetImagePathIfExists' method retrieves the image path if it exists, otherwise, it removes it from the index. \n\nThe class also contains methods to handle various user interactions with images.

The 'OnImageCopy' method handles clicks to the image copy button. The 'OnImageOpen' method handles clicks to the image open-in-explorer button. \n\nThe class also provides functionality for exporting images in various formats. The 'ImageExportImpl' method handles the image export functionality. The 'OnImageExportPng', 'OnImageExportPngWithMetadata', 'OnImageExportJpeg', and 'OnImageExportWebp' methods handle exporting the image in PNG, PNG with metadata, JPEG, and WebP formats respectively.\"",

    "detailed_description": "The `Prompt` record, defined in the `StabilityMatrix.Avalonia.Models.Inference` namespace, represents a data model for processing and validating input prompts with additional embedded information regarding external networks. This record is composed of various properties, methods, and attributes that serve specific roles in managing the prompt data.\n\nMembers of the `Prompt` record:\n\n- `RawText`: A required property of type `string`, which is initialized when the record is created. This property holds the raw text input that will be processed.\n\n- `TokenizeResult`: Another required property, which holds an `ITokenizeLineResult` object. This property is initialized with the results of tokenizing the `RawText`.\n\n- `IsProcessed`: A boolean property that indicates whether the prompt has been processed. Initially set to `false`, the `Process` method sets this flag to `true`.\n\n- `ExtraNetworks`: A nullable property of type `IReadOnlyList<PromptExtraNetwork>`. It stores information about any extra networks specified in the raw prompt text after processing.\n\n- `ProcessedText`: A nullable `string` property containing the processed text suitable for sending to an inference backend, with extra network tokens excluded.\n\n- `Process()`: A method that processes the prompt, populating the `ExtraNetworks` and `ProcessedText` properties. If the prompt is already processed, indicated by `IsProcessed`, the method returns immediately.\n\n- `ValidateExtraNetworks(IModelIndexService)`: A method that throws a `PromptValidationError` if the models referred to in the `ExtraNetworks` do not exist locally. The `IModelIndexService` is used to check against local models.\n\n- `GetExtraNetworksAsLocalModels(IModelIndexService)`: This method returns an `IEnumerable` of tuples containing `LocalModelFile`, `ModelWeight`, and `ClipWeight` representing local model files and weights. It throws an `InvalidOperationException` if called before the prompt is processed.\n\n- `GetDebugText()`: A method that formats the tokens included in the `TokenizeResult` along with their scopes into a string for debugging purposes.\n\n- `FromRawText(string, ITokenizerProvider)`: A static method used to create a new instance of `Prompt` from a raw text string. It utilizes a provided `ITokenizerProvider`.\n\n- `Process()`, `ValidateExtraNetworks(IModelIndexService)`, and `GetExtraNetworksAsLocalModels(IModelIndexService)` contain the `[MemberNotNull]` attribute, ensuring that after these methods are called, the `ExtraNetworks` and `ProcessedText` properties are not null.\n\n- The `GetSafeEndIndex` private method is a helper method to ensure the index specified does not exceed the length of the `RawText`.\n\n- The `GetExtraNetworks` private method parses tokens and constructs the `ExtraNetworks` list and a processed text string by tokenizing and processing the `RawText`. It can optionally validate model names using an `IModelIndexService`.\n\nEach method and property serves to abstract the complexity involved in processing and validating text prompts with embedded network instructions, ensuring that the `Prompt` record can be used to reliably manage a clean and validated set of data for interfacing with an inference backend. The record's primary functions involve token parsing, network identification, preprocessing for backend use, and validation of network models.",

This class is affiliated with the Avalonia UI framework, as indicated by the use of namespaces and certain Avalonia-specific types and components. It inherits from `ViewModelBase`, suggesting that `CheckpointFolder` serves as a ViewModel in an MVVM architecture.\n\nThe class is attributed with `[ManagedService]` and `[Transient]`, which suggests it is meant to be treated as a service that can be injected into other components and has a transient lifecycle (a new instance is provided every time one is requested).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the class members:\n\n1. **Fields:**\n    - `settingsManager`: An injected service likely used to manage application settings.\n    - `downloadService`: An injected service likely used for handling file downloads.\n    - `modelFinder`: An injected service used for locating model information.\n    - `notificationService`: An injected service for displaying notifications to the user.\n    - `metadataImportService`: An injected service for importing metadata.\n    - `SubFoldersCache`: A `SourceCache` which maintains a collection of `CheckpointFolder` objects keyed by their directory path.\n    - `checkpointFilesCache`: A private `SourceCache` for caching `CheckpointFile` objects keyed by their file path.\n    - `useCategoryVisibility`: A flag indicating whether the visibility of categories should be considered in the UI.\n\n2. **Properties:**\n    - `DirectoryPath`: A `string` representing the absolute path to the folder.\n    - `Title`: A `string` for the custom title displayed in the UI. Annotated to notify changes to related properties.\n    - `folderType`: An enum that specifies the type of shared folder. It participates in property change notification.\n    - `isCategoryEnabled`, `isExpanded`, `isCurrentDragTarget`, `isImportInProgress`: Boolean properties reflecting various states relevant for UI interaction.\n    - `searchFilter`: A `string` property that reflects the filter text used to narrow down search results.\n    - `IsDragBlurEnabled`: A read-only boolean property that indicates whether a blur effect is triggered due to drag operations or import progress.\n    - `TitleWithFilesCount`: A read-only string property that provides a combined view of the folder title and a count of files.\n    - `Progress`: An instance of a `ProgressViewModel` used for reporting operation progress to the UI.\n    - `ParentFolder`: A reference to the parent `CheckpointFolder`, allowing for a hierarchical folder structure.\n    - `SubFolders`: An observable collection of subfolders.\n    - `CheckpointFiles`: An observable collection representing files within the folder.\n    - `DisplayedCheckpointFiles`: An observable collection of `CheckpointFile` that are filtered based on `searchFilter` and other criteria.\n\n3. **Constructor:**\n    - Receives various service instances and an optional `useCategoryVisibility` boolean, initializing respective fields, and configures behavior for the `checkpointFilesCache` and `SubFoldersCache`. It sets up the reactions to changes in these collections and the required sorting and filtering. The constructor ends by registering to the `CollectionChanged` event of the `CheckpointFiles`.\n\n4. **Partial Methods:**\n    - Methods and event handlers that handle property changes (such as `OnTitleChanged`, `OnSearchFilterChanged`, `OnIsCategoryEnabledChanged`) and certain collection changes (such as `OnCheckpointFilesChanged`).\n\n5. **Task Handling Methods:**\n    - Methods such as `OnDrop`, `ShowInExplorer`, `Delete`, `CreateSubFolder`, `MoveBetweenFolders`, `ImportFilesAsync`, `FindConnectedMetadata` handle tasks related to file and folder manipulation, drag and drop functionality, and other UI triggered actions. They typically involve asynchronous operations.\n\n6. **Command Attributes:**\n    - `[RelayCommand]`: These are attributes applied to methods to indicate that they can be bound to commands in the UI. Example methods include `ShowInExplorer`, `Delete`, and `CreateSubFolder`.\n\n7. **Private Methods:**\n    - `DelayedClearProgress`: A private method that clears the progress after a certain delay.\n    - `GetCheckpointFiles`: Gets files from the folder index.\n    - `BackgroundIndex`: Conducts indexing in the background without blocking the UI thread.\n    - `Index`: Refreshes the `CheckpointFiles` collection by indexing the folder for new files.\n\nThis class seems to represent a checkpoint system where folders and their contents can be managed, indexed, and manipulated, possibly in the context of version control or file management in a software application.",
